While dealing with ML problems, there are generally two types of data:
. Supervised data: always has one or multiple targets associated with it.
. Unsupervised data: data does not have any target variable

The columns are features and rows are called samples and supervised data has a target variable.
If the target is categorical then the problem is defined as classification problem. If the target is real, then it is regression problem.
It must be noted that sometimes we might use regression in a classification setting depending on the metric used for evaluation.

Unsupervised problems has several approaches but the important one is clustering. Techniques like PCA, t-SNE are used. 

.We can see how t-SNE is used for MNIST dataset.
1) importing all the required libraries
2) Getting  dataset
3) Visualize a single image
4) t-SNE transformation of data

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import manifold
%matplotlib inline

data = datasets.fetch_openml(
                    'mnist_784',
                    version=1,
                    return_X_y=True
)
pixel_values, targets = data
targets = targets.astype(int)

single_image = pixel_values[1,:].reshape(28,28)
plt.imshow(single_image,cmap='gray')

tsne = manifold.TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
transformed_data = tsne.fit_transform(pixel_values[:3000, :])
